## "Delay VST Plugin"
In this repository i include all project files for a simple delay plugin that i am currently trying to develop.
I used JUCE for the plugin development.
This project was created for the "Digital Audio Technology" course (University of Patras).


## Description
In order to implement the delay i used the universal comb filter [1].
The codes is not working yet. It needs debugging.
